# Webchat Alpha

This project explores patterns and 3rd party webchat implementations. It implements prototypes which are copies of real pages and services on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk), with added webchat support flows and call to actions.

Prior art: [webchat-prototype](https://github.com/alphagov/webchat-prototype)

## Building and running

This is based on the [GOV.UK prototype kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit), so most instructions that apply to that work here too. In short:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:alphagov/webchat-alpha.git
cd webchat-alpha
npm i
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

Tested on node `v4.x` and `v6.x`, and npm `v3.x`.
