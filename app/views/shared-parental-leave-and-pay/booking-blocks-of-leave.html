              <h1>6. Booking blocks of leave</h1> </header>
            <p>You can book up to 3 separate blocks of Shared Parental Leave (<abbr title="Shared Parental Leave">SPL</abbr>) instead of taking it all in one go, even if you aren’t sharing the leave with your partner.</p>
            <p>If your partner is also eligible for <abbr title="Shared Parental Leave">SPL</abbr>, you can take up to 3 blocks of leave each. You can take leave at different times or both at the same time.</p>
            <p>You must tell your employer about your plans for leave when you <a href="/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/apply-for-shared-parental-leave">apply for <abbr title="Shared Parental Leave">SPL</abbr></a>. You can change these plans later but you
              must give your employer at least 8 weeks’ notice before you want to begin a block of leave.</p>
            <h2>Splitting blocks of leave</h2>
            <p>If your employer agrees, you can split blocks into shorter periods of at least a week.</p>
            <div class="example">
              <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
              <p>A mother finishes her maternity leave at the end of October and takes the rest of her leave as <abbr title="Shared Parental Leave">SPL</abbr>. She shares it with her partner, who’s also eligible. They each take the whole of November as their
                first blocks of <abbr title="Shared Parental Leave">SPL</abbr>. The partner then returns to work.</p>
              <p>The mother also returns to work in December. She gives her employer notice that she’ll go on leave again in February - this is her second block of <abbr title="Shared Parental Leave">SPL</abbr>. Her employer agrees to a work pattern of 2
                weeks on, 2 weeks off during the block.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Shared Parental Leave in touch (<abbr title="Shared Parental Leave in touch">SPLIT</abbr>) days</h2>
            <p>You and your partner can each work up to 20 days while you’re taking <abbr title="Shared Parental Leave">SPL</abbr>. These are called ‘Shared Parental Leave in touch’ (or <abbr title="Shared Parental Leave in touch">SPLIT</abbr>) days.</p>
            <p>These days are in addition to the 10 <a href="/employee-rights-when-on-leave">‘keeping in touch’</a> (or <abbr title="keeping in touch">KIT</abbr>) days available to those on maternity or adoption leave.</p>
            <p><abbr title="keeping in touch">KIT</abbr> and <abbr title="Shared Parental Leave in touch">SPLIT</abbr> days are optional - both you and your employer must agree to them.</p>
