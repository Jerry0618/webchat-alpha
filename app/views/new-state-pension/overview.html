            <p>The new State Pension is a regular payment from the government that you can claim if you reach <a href="#">State Pension age</a> on or after 6 April 2016.</p>
            <p>You can get the new State Pension if <a href="/new-state-pension/eligibility">you’re eligible</a> and:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>a man born on or after 6 April 1951</li>
              <li>a woman born on or after 6 April 1953</li>
            </ul>
            <div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
              <p>If you reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016, you’ll get the State Pension under the <a href="#">old rules</a> instead.</p>
            </div>
            <p>You can still get a State Pension if you have other income like a <a href="#">personal pension</a> or a <a href="#">workplace pension</a>.</p>
            <h2>How much you can get</h2>
            <p>The full new State Pension is £155.65 per week.</p>
            <p>Your <a href="/new-state-pension/your-national-insurance-record-and-your-state-pension">National Insurance record</a> is used to calculate your new State Pension.</p>
            <p>You’ll usually need 10 qualifying years to get any new State Pension.</p>
            <p>The amount you get can be higher or lower depending on your National Insurance record. It will only be higher if you have over a certain amount of Additional State Pension.</p>
            <p>You might have to <a href="#">pay tax on your State Pension</a>.</p>
            <h2>Working after State Pension age</h2>
            <p>You don’t have to stop working when you reach State Pension age but you’ll no longer have to pay <a href="#">National Insurance</a>. You can
              also request <a href="#">flexible working arrangements</a>.</p>
