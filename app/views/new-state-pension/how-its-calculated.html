              <h1>4. How it's calculated</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Your new State Pension is based on your <a href="/new-state-pension/your-national-insurance-record-and-your-state-pension">National Insurance record</a>.</p>
            <h2>Valuing your National Insurance contributions and credits made before 6 April 2016</h2>
            <p>Your National Insurance record before 6 April 2016 is used to calculate your ‘starting amount’. This is part of your new State Pension.</p>
            <p>Your starting amount will be the higher of either:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the amount you would get under the old State Pension rules (which includes <a href="#">basic State Pension</a> and <a href="#">Additional State Pension</a>)</li>
              <li>the amount you would get if the new State Pension had been in place at the start of your working life</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your starting amount will include a deduction <a href="/new-state-pension/youve-been-in-a-workplace-personal-or-stakeholder-pension">if you were contracted out</a> of the Additional State Pension. You may have been contracted out because you
              were in a certain type of workplace, personal or stakeholder pension.</p>
            <h3>If your starting amount is less than the full new State Pension</h3>
            <p>You can get more State Pension by adding more qualifying years to your National Insurance record after 5 April 2016. You can do this until you reach the full new State Pension amount or reach State Pension age - whichever is first.</p>
            <div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
                <p>Each qualifying year on your National Insurance record after 5 April 2016 will add about £4.45 a week to your new State Pension. The exact amount you get is calculated by dividing £155.65 by 35.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example">
              <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
              <p>You had a starting amount from your National Insurance record before 6 April 2016 of £120 a week.</p>
              <p>You have another 5 qualifying years on your National Insurance record after 5 April 2016 (each year adding about £4.45 a week to your State Pension) equalling £22.25 a week.</p>
              <p>This adds up to about £142.25 a week for your State Pension.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>If your starting amount is more than the full new State Pension</h3>
            <p>The part of your starting amount which is above the full new State Pension is called your ‘protected payment’.</p>
            <p>Your protected payment is paid on top of the full new State Pension and increases each year in line with inflation.</p>
            <div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
              <p>Any qualifying years you have after 5 April 2016 won’t add more to your State Pension.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>You didn’t make National Insurance contributions or get National Insurance credits before 6 April 2016</h2>
            <p>Your State Pension will be calculated entirely under the new State Pension rules.</p>
            <p>You’ll usually need at least 10 qualifying years on your <a href="/new-state-pension/your-national-insurance-record-and-your-state-pension">National Insurance record</a> to get any State Pension.</p>
            <p>You’ll need 35 qualifying years to get the full new State Pension.</p>
            <p>You’ll get a proportion of the new State Pension if you have between 10 and 35 qualifying years.</p>
            <div class="example">
              <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
              <p>You have 20 qualifying years on your National Insurance record after 6 April 2016.</p>
              <p>You multiply 20 qualifying years by £4.45 (£155.65 divided by 35).</p>
              <p>Your new State Pension will be about £89 per week.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Your new State Pension is more likely to be calculated in this way if you were born after the year 2000 or became a resident of the UK after 2015.</p>
